               The town of Asheville is a small, vibrant city surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. The 300-acre campus is idyllic – it is on the National Register of Historic Places, and the chapel is frequently used for wedding during the summer. A regional airport provides easy access to Asheville – Charlotte is two hours’ drive and Atlanta is three hours away.

                <p class="card-text">
                Asheville is a relatively small boarding school with a strong sense of community and values. It’s also a non-denominational Christian school - the entire student body meets several times a week for chapel services and chapel talks. The head of school, Arch Montgomery, is known for being very accessible to students and parents.

                Asheville has alumni in 50 states and 35 countries, but the majority of students come from the south-east. Roughly half stay in the south-east for College - the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alone admits a quarter of Asheville’s graduates.

                Asheville is perfect for those who love the outdoors. All students go on at least one overnight camping trip in the first year. The school has an equestrian program and a mountaineering program Riding lessons at all levels are available – either on school-owned or student-owned horses. The mountaineering program includes mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, whitewater kayaking, ice climbing, skiing and caving. According to one student - “The Mountaineering Program is something everyone should do”.

                <p class="card-text">
                The curriculum is rigorous – 18 AP courses are offered and a handful of students take as many as 10 APs. The school has a distinctive approach to humanities. The four year sequence of courses comprises Ancient Studies, World Studies, European Studies, and American Studies. Each course integrates literature, history, religion, art, and music. For example, when learning about the Jazz Age, students read the Great Gatsby, study 1920s art, history, and music, and visit the Grove Park Inn, where the Fitzgeralds frequently stayed.
